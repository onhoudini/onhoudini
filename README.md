## Hi, I'm Gabriel

My english it's still not really good, I have a good capacity understanding texts and audios, but I still don't have enough practice writting (I take some help of copilot to write what is bellow here).

I am 24 years old and a Computer Science student at UNIPAMPA. My focus is on learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications. I have worked with LLM, Transformer, SBERT, among others, and I am currently studying more deeply to better understand these concepts and enhance my capacity to apply them.

I am also taking a Cyber Security course at DESEC, developing an online RPG project, and learning drawing techniques.
